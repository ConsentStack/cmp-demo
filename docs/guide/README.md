# Introduction

#### Orbis is excited to bring the IAB Europeâ€™s Transparency & Consent framework to publishers, brands and website owners with the Pluto Privacy Manager, to help handle GDPR compliance, and improve user experience across your web properties.

## What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is European regulation that replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, and was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens with regard to their data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.

The GDPR goes into effect May 25, 2018 and, in addition to the existing Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive) (and the proposed ePrivacy Regulation, which would replace the ePrivacy Directive), it will change the way companies around the world interact with individuals located in the EU, including the way they access, acquire, use, share, and store personal data, and how they provide individuals with access to their own personal data.

## What is ePrivacy?

The ePrivacy Directive, as amended in 2009, put in place specific requirements related to the use of local storage, which includes the use of cookies. Today, under local European laws that implemented the ePrivacy Directive, web property owners must give the individuals visiting their apps, sites and other digital mediums; information about their use of local storage. Many of those laws also require websites to obtain consent for the use of local storage. Whether consent is necessary (and if it is, what is considered sufficient) may change under local laws. And, an update to the ePrivacy Directive, the proposed ePrivacy Regulation, is being formulated and will likely further alter the requirements.

## What is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework?

#### The Framework provides website operators with the following:
1. Allows website operators to control the vendors they wish to allow to access to their users' browsers/devices, and process their personal data and disclose these choices to other parties in the online advertising ecosystem.
2. Allows website operators and vendors to seek user consent under the ePrivacy Directive (for setting cookies or similar tech and accessing information on a device) and/or the GDPR in line with applicable legal requirements and disseminate the consent status through the online advertising ecosystem.
3. Have one place to go to:
    - Understand privacy-related disclosures about those vendors.
    - Use those disclosures to make privacy-related disclosures to its users generally.
    - Provide disclosures required to be provided by vendors that are Controllers to end users.
    - Seek user consent in line with applicable legal requirements where vendors may require it under the ePrivacy Directive and/or GDPR for various purposes.
    - Disseminate the consent status through the online advertising ecosystem.

#### The various pieces of the framework include:
- A global vendor list.
- The reference architecture (for cookie format and vendor list and related API's).
- A Policy that participating publishers, vendors and consent management providers (CMPs) must adhere to that covers:
    - The disclosures to be made by vendors included on the global vendor list.
    - The use of the global vendor list and the reference architecture.

## What is a CMP?

Within the IAB framework, a CMP is a technology that can capture and store the consent status of a user and transmit that information to ecosystem partners. 

The Pluto Privacy Manager, is an IAB registered technology. It implements the framework as designated by the IAB but differentiates itself by implementing human-centered design, to improve the experience your customers will receive. More information on this can be found in other materials.

## Where is Consent Stored?

Vendor information and consent can technically be stored anywhere as long as the information is exposed through the CMP API. Currently the Pluto CMP uses cookies to store the consent information, but we are actively developing other methods.
